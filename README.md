# TFT-item-project
Analyzes average item placements and performance statistics in Teamfight Tactics (TFT) to help players optimize their builds

Build Item Database
Uses Java to build all of the necessary database tables by polling Riot's API, the developer of TFT's API in which they give access to their data.
It is limited by the developer key I have access to, which can only be polled 100 times every 2 mintues.

TFT Item Android App
The Android app frontend which displays all of the TFT items and their average placement.
